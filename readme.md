# Darts

Play darts with alwaysAI and the Intel RealSense depth camera!

## Setup

This app requires an alwaysAI account. Head to the
[Sign up page](https://www.alwaysai.co/dashboard) if you don't have an account
yet. Follow the instructions to install the alwaysAI tools on your development
machine.

This app also requires an Intel RealSense D435[i] is attached. RealSense
cameras requires a USB 3.x connection. If you've connected to a USB 3.x
connection and it still fails, try a different cable.

## Usage

Once you have the alwaysAI tools installed and a RealSense camera connected,
run the following CLI commands at the top level of the repo:

```
aai app configure
aai app install
aai app start
```
